## ‚ú® What's Included

### Cost Waste Optimization
Analyze **50+ AWS services** for cost-saving opportunities:
- **Compute:** EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, EMR
- **Storage:** EBS, S3, EFS, FSx
- **Database:** RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Redshift, DocumentDB
- **Networking:** NAT Gateway, Load Balancers, VPC, Transit Gateway
- **Data & Analytics:** Glue, Kinesis
- **AI/ML:** SageMaker
- And many more...

### Security Audits
Security scanning for **4 core AWS services:**
- **IAM:** 15+ security checks (admin access, MFA, inactive credentials, overly permissive policies)
- **S3:** 10+ security checks (public buckets, encryption, versioning, access logging)
- **EC2:** 8+ security checks (public instances, security groups, IMDSv2, unencrypted volumes)
- **RDS:** 12+ security checks (public databases, encryption, backups, multi-AZ)

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-Region Scanning** - Scan all AWS regions or target specific ones
- **Reserved Instance Awareness** - Optionally exclude resources covered by RI/Savings Plans
- **Business Impact Scoring** - Prioritize opportunities by implementation complexity
- **Detailed Remediation** - Step-by-step guides for each optimization
- **Interactive Mode** - User-friendly prompts for easy scanning
- **Privacy-First** - Anonymous telemetry (opt-in), no sensitive data collected
- **Read-Only Operations** - Safe to use in production, never modifies infrastructure

## üìñ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with credentials (`aws configure` or AWS SSO)
- Read-only IAM permissions (AWS managed policy `ReadOnlyAccess` recommended)

### Your First Scan

**Interactive Mode (Easiest):**
```bash
nebu
```

**Direct Commands:**
```bash
# Scan for cost waste (all regions, exclude RI/SP covered resources)
nebu aws waste your-profile exclude

# Scan for cost waste (specific region)
nebu aws waste your-profile exclude us-east-1

# Security audit (all regions)
nebu aws security your-profile

# Security audit (specific region)
nebu aws security your-profile us-west-2
```
